# AI Usage Documentation
AI Assistance Disclosure and Methodological Notes

This project incorporates the use of modern large-language-model (LLM) systems as part of the software-development workflow. The purpose of this documentation is to provide a transparent, academically rigorous account of how AI tools were used, the scope of their involvement, and the extent to which the final implementation represents original human contributions.

1. Role of AI Tools in the Development Process

AI systems (primarily OpenAI’s ChatGPT) were used as an auxiliary resource to support, not replace, the analytical and coding responsibilities of the project author(s). Specifically, AI assistance was used for:

Technical troubleshooting during environment setup, including Python virtual-environment configuration, dependency installations, and Jupyter kernel selection.

Clarification of API behaviors for libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Generation of boilerplate code templates, which were then modified, extended, and adapted manually to meet project requirements.

Structured refinement of explanations and documentation, ensuring conceptual accuracy and consistency throughout the notebook and README.

All code related to model selection, feature preparation, training/testing logic, ensemble-model implementation (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting), and performance visualization was written, tested, and validated by the project contributors. AI suggestions were evaluated critically, integrated selectively, and revised to fit the project’s methodology.

2. Non-Delegated Human Work

The following tasks were performed independently and were not outsourced to AI:

Selection and justification of ensemble learning algorithms.

Determination of evaluation metrics (accuracy and F1-score) and implementation details.

Interpretation of model results and construction of comparison plots.

Validation of dataset structure, data-cleaning decisions, and preprocessing steps.

Git version-control operations, including commits, merges, and repository organization.

This ensures that the intellectual work, domain reasoning, and methodological decisions remain attributable to the human contributors.

3. Compliance With Academic Integrity Standards

All AI usage adheres to the course guidelines, which explicitly allow the use of machine-learning assistants for:

debugging,

explanation,

code refinement,

documentation support.

AI was not used to fully automate the assignment, generate solutions without understanding, or circumvent the project’s learning objectives.

The final notebook represents an integrated effort in which AI served as a supplementary tool, while all critical design, reasoning, and programming decisions were made by the project team.
